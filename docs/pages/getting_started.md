# Getting Started

Hoist the harness. Whatever; we start, as always, with 
[create-react-app](./create-react-app.html).

This bootraps a simple React app into the __/src__ directory, 
including all the tooling the good folk at facebook use give us. 

Create React App is our baseline. everything we do should be able 
to be simply dropped into here and work straight off the bat. 
Making sure they also work in Vivid will come later.

```bash
cd <your-working-dir>
git clone https://github.com/rexlabsio/neo-containers.git
cd neo-containers
git checkout step/1/create-react-app
yarn
yarn start
```

If a react app doesn't pop up on 3000, 
don't proceed until you've debugged it.
